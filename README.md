# Visualizing-with-Matplotlib

## Visualizations of airplane crash data constructed with Matplotlib.

How have airplane crashes trended over time? Who were the worst operators in terms of airplane crashes? How do fatalities compare to crashes? These questions are all answered with a set of notebooks that manipulate and visualize a dataset containing airplane crash information from 1908 to 2019. The charts are shown below.
